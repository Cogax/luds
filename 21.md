LUD-21: Guarantee payment amount in a localized currency using `payRequest`.
================================================

`author: ethanrose`

---

The idea here is that the recipient needs to receive an exact amount of fiat currency. Typically this is for a point-of-sale use-case where a lightning service is acting as a bitcoin-to-fiat payment processor. Currently, a sender would have to use their own calculator to determine how many sats to pay, and the recipient inevitably would receive the wrong amount. This is a massive hinderance to merchant adoption of lightning.

## 1. `currency` record in payRequest details

If `SERVICE` wishes for a `WALLET` user to specify a payment amount in a different currency, it MUST alter its JSON response in the payRequest details response to include a `currency` field, as follows:

```diff
 {
   "callback": String,
   "maxSendable": number,
   "minSendable": number,
   "metadata": string,
+  "currency": {
+    "options": ["SAT", "PHP"],
+    "default": "PHP",
+    "rateEstimates": { "PHP": 1400000.45, "SAT": 100000000 },
+    "sendable": {
+      "min": { "PHP": 1, "SAT": 1 },
+      "max": { "PHP": 50000, "SAT": 1000000 }
+    },
+    "currencyParamSupported": true
+  },
   "tag": "payRequest",
 }
```

## 2. User interface for specifying currency

If there is a `currency` record in the initial response, `WALLET` displays a modified interface:

- If there is more than one currency in the `currency.options`, `WALLET` should give user a dropdown to change currencies.
- The selected currency option should default to `currency.default`.
- `WALLET` should display the currently selected currency to the user.
- The wallet should do a preliminary validation that the user has enough funds based on `currency.rateEstimates`.
  - It is advisable to add 3% padding to the min/max available balance, as exchange rate fluctuations may cause the actual payment request to be higher or lower than expected.
- The sender may optionally display an estimated cost in the user's local currency by using `currency.rateEstimates`


## 3. Including `currency` in callback parameters

Some services need to lock-in an exact exchange rate in local currency, while other services prefer using the unmodified LNURL-Pay flow.

If SERVICE includes `currency.currencyParamSupported: true`, wallet must add a `currency` query parameter to the callback, and specify the `amount` in the currency:

```diff
- <callback><?|&>amount=<milliSatoshi>
+ <callback><?|&>amount=<philippinePeso>&currency=PHP
```

However, if `currency.currencyParamSupported` is false or undefined, the wallet must use millisats (standard LNURL-Pay callback!)

## 4. User interface for reviewing & confirming the exchange rate

`SERVICE` responds with a payment request (`pr`). Payment of this `pr` must guarantee that the recipient will receive the defined amount of currency. Typically, the `SERVICE` will generate these `pr`s with a quick expiry time (30-120 seconds) since they are locking an exchange rate.
- `WALLET` must display a confirmation screen where the user can review the amount that will be deducted from their local wallet (i.e. satoshi) and the amount that the external recipient will receive (i.e. philippine pesos).
- If the `pr` expires, wallet should either inform the user that the exchange rate has expired 
- The `WALLET` may opt to automatically refresh the exchange by calling the callback again before the previous `pr` expires.

If the user approves, they may tap a button to "confirm" acceptance of the exchange rate.
