LUD-21: Pay in a different currency.
================================================

`author: ethanrose`

The idea here is to enable a merchant to receive an exact payment amount, in whatever currency their goods are priced in (i.e. their own fiat currency). A sender should be able to input the amount in the currency that they are invoiced in by the seller as well.

Typically this is for a point-of-sale use-case where a lightning service is acting as a bitcoin-to-fiat payment processor. Currently, a sender would have to use their own calculator to determine how many sats to pay, and the recipient inevitably would receive the close-but-wrong amount. This bad experience is a hinderance to adoption of lightning as a cross-border payment system.

## 1. `currency` record in payRequest details

If `SERVICE` wishes for a `WALLET` user to specify a payment amount in a different currency, it MUST alter its JSON response in the payRequest details response to include a `currency` object, as follows:

```diff
 {
   "callback": String,
   "maxSendable": number,
   "minSendable": number,
   "metadata": string,
+  "currency": {
+    "code": "PHP",
+    "name": "Philippine Pesos",
+    "symbol": "â‚±",
+    "minSendable": 1,
+    "maxSendable": 50000
+  },
   "tag": "payRequest",
 }
```

## 2. User interface for specifying currency

If there is a `currency` record in the initial response, `WALLET` displays a modified interface:
- The wallet should display the `currency.code` and/or `currency.name` instead of its default currency.

## 3. Including `currency` in callback parameters

In the next step of the LNURL-Pay flow, `WALLET` must include a `currency` query parameter in the callback along with the `amount`:

```diff
- <callback><?|&>amount=<milliSatoshi>
+ <callback><?|&>amount=<philippinePeso>&currency=PHP
```

- `SERVICE` must respond with a BOLT11 payment request (`pr`) with a short expiry time (i.e. 30 seconds) corresponding to the length of time the service is willing to guarantee the exchange rate.

## 4. User interface for reviewing & confirming the exchange rate

- `WALLET` must display a confirmation screen where the user can review and approve the amount that will be deducted from their local wallet currency.
