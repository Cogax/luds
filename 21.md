LUD-21: Pay in local unit of account.
================================================

`author: ethanrose`

The idea here is to enable a merchant to receive an exact payment amount, in whatever currency their goods are priced in (i.e. their own fiat currency). A sender should be able to input the amount in the recipient's own unit of account.

Typically this is for a point-of-sale use-case where a lightning service is acting as a bitcoin-to-fiat payment processor. Currently, a sender would have to use their own calculator to determine how many sats to pay, and the recipient inevitably would receive the close-but-wrong amount. This bad experience is a hinderance to adoption of lightning as a cross-border payment system.

## 1. `currency` record in payRequest details

If `SERVICE` wishes for a `WALLET` user to specify a payment amount in a different currency, it MUST alter its JSON response in the payRequest details response to include a `currency` object, as follows:

```diff
 {
   "callback": String,
   "maxSendable": number,
   "minSendable": number,
   "metadata": string,
+  "currency": {
+    "code": "PHP",
+    "name": "Philippine Pesos",
+    "symbol": "â‚±",
+    "minSendable": 1,
+    "maxSendable": 50000,
+    "rateEstimate": 1500000 // Approx. rate for 1 BTC
+  },
   "tag": "payRequest",
 }
```

## 2. User interface for specifying currency

If there is a `currency` record in the initial response, `WALLET` displays a modified interface:
- The wallet should display the `currency.code` and/or `currency.name` instead of its default currency.

## 3. Including `currency` in callback parameters

In the next step of the LNURL-Pay flow, `WALLET` must include a `currency` query parameter in the callback along with the `amount`:

```diff
- <callback><?|&>amount=<milliSatoshi>
+ <callback><?|&>amount=<philippinePeso>&currency=PHP
```

- `SERVICE` must respond with a BOLT11 payment request (`pr`) with a short expiry time (i.e. 30 seconds) corresponding to the length of time the service is willing to guarantee the exchange rate.

## 4. User interface for reviewing & confirming the exchange rate

- `WALLET` must display a confirmation screen where the user can review/verify and "approve" the amount that will be deducted from their local wallet currency.


> IMPORTANT: This LNURL specification opens up new vectors for services to perpetrate scams -- services may trick senders into accepting a bad exchange rate if the sender quickly "accepts" the rate (that is, if sender chooses to "trust" instead of taking their opportunity to "verify" the rate displayed on the confirmation screen). It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED for wallets to add additional protection against services attempting to use dishonest exchange rates:
> - (Low Effort) A wallet may offer a generic warning along the lines of `Caution: This exchange rate may differ from market rate!`
> - (Medium Effort) A wallet may wish to audit the exchange rate against market rate based on a 3rd party API, (i.e. CoinGecko) and warn the user accordingly.
